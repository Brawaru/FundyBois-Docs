Installing Sodium mod to Minecraft
==================================

.. warning:: This page is WIP and might be lacking some details.

Sodium is alternative optimisation mod to Minecraft developed by Jellysquid.
Unlike OptiFine it is primarily focused on optimising the game, not adding
the features enchancing its looks.

Installing
----------

.. note:: Sodium requires :doc:`Fabric mod loader <fabric>` to work.

You can either install all the mods manually, or you can use complete mod
pack ‘Fabulously Optimised’ that contains Jellysquid's mods as well as mods
that add features like zooming, dynamic FPS, dynamic lights, etc.
