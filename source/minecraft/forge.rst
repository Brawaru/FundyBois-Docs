Installing Forge
================

If you prefer more sophisticated system for mods, Forge mod loader is a way
to go. It's been with us and probably not going away any time soon.

Installing
----------

Forge install is similar to OptiFine, it's very easy:

.. admonition:: Java is required
   :class: warning

   Java required to run Forge installer. You can install Java manually or
   use one :doc:`provided with Minecraft Launcher <provided_java>`.

1. Download Installer from `Forge site <https://files.minecraftforge.net/>`_.

   Make sure the version of the game is correct, you also might prefer using
   Forge version denoted as ‘Recommended’, although that depends on mods you
   are using.

   Do not download ‘Launcher’ file, what you need is ‘Installer’.

2. Check :guilabel:`Install client` and make sure path to game is correct.

3. Click :guilabel:`OK` and wait until technical gibberish finishes.

4. As ‘Complete’ message pops up, installation is complete.

5. Reload your launcher to see new Forge profile.

.. _mcl_profile-folder:

.. note::
   After restart, in default Minecraft Launcher you can find Forge profile
   under the ‘Installations’ tab: hover over the Forge profile and click
   |fa-folder| folder icon next to :guilabel:`Play` button to open its folder.

.. |fa-folder| raw:: html

Installing mods
---------------

1. Download your mod. Make sure it supports your game version.

   If your mod depends on any other mod, you can install it the same way.

2. Open Minecraft profile folder:

   * :ref:`CurseForge <cf_profile-folder>`
   * :ref:`Minecraft Launcher <mcl_profile-folder>`

3. Open ``mods`` folder (or create if it doesn't exist).

4. Drop your mod's JAR file in this folder.

5. Launch the game, you don't need to restart launcher.

.. note::
   Regurarly check for updates to mods you have installed as they may
   contain crash and security fixes, as well as introduce new features.

.. admonition:: For players of the SMP
   :class: warning

   If you plan on playing our on SMP server, install only client-side mods.

   Do not install mods that introduce unfair advantage over others, as
   these might get you banned from the server and Discord.

   For example, a minimap mod would be okay (only ones that do not disclose
   other players' locations), while mod for fence jumping or literally flying
   is not.
