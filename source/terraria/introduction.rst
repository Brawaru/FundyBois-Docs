Terraria SMP
============

It's time for the pixel adventure! THE BOYZ starts a new server for Terraria
game. Gather supplies, build, and defeat the enemies from pesky slimes to
the greatest of the bosses. Terraria is a large adventure!

How to Join
-----------

You need to have a PC, our server runs Terraria **1.4.1.2**.

Host IP and port are available in ``#gaming`` channel of Discord.

Server Rules
------------

1. **No cheating, hacking or glitching**. Obivous staff, keep the game fair!
2. **Do not grief other players' builds**. With intention or not, players put
   an effort into building stuff â€” getting it destroyed is not fun at all,
   nor it's a good method of revenge.
3. **Play only with fresh characters**. Do not bring loot from other worlds
   or characters. Every item obtained has to be obtained in our world.
4. **Try following collective progression**. Do not proceed to hard mode
   without other players, let them be prepared for what's to come. It's,
   however, understandable if you don't want to invite everyone for the
   boss fight as defeating the boss tends to be difficult this way.
5. **General rules of Discord apply to in-game chat**. Keep it civil and do
   not send any inappropriate content that would not be welcomed in Discord.
   All chat messages are logged, so don't expect your actions to go unseen.

Any violations of the rules may result in permanent ban from the game and
in certain scenarios, from the Discord server itself. We hope you have fun
and none of that takes place. Thank you!

Installing the Game
-------------------

We encouarge you to buy Terraria, it's not that expensive and worth even more
than it is. However, we know that not all of our members can afford even that,
therefore we have a separate download.

Please, check out the options:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Steam

      You can buy and play the game on Steam. Familiar experience and frequent
      discounts, buy and install, connect to your Terraria friends without
      leaving the game.

      .. raw:: html

         <iframe
            src="https://store.steampowered.com/widget/105600/8183/"
            frameborder="0"
            width="450"
            height="190">
         </iframe>

   .. tab:: GOG

      DRM-free store, buy and install, play at any time even without internet
      connection. Don't play the game? You can loan it to your relative or
      friend. Neat!

      .. raw:: html

         <div class="gog-widget" data-game="1207665503"></div>

         <script type="text/javascript">
            (() => {
               window.gogWidgetDistributorId = '0';
               const scr = document.createElement('script');
               scr.type = 'text/javascript';
               scr.src = 'https://api.gog.com/v1/distributors/widget-latest.js';
               scr.async = true;
               document.body.appendChild(scr);
            })();
         </script>

   .. tab:: Download

      This is an option for those of you who don't have money. We have a
      download of the game that you can play, however let's make an agreement!

      If you liked the Terraria and played it for as long as, say, two hours,
      consider purchasing it when you have the money: add it to your wishlist
      to remember and get notified when the next discount is available.

      Terraria is a great game and it's worth every penny you pay for it and
      even more. It has tons of content and quite extensible with mods when
      you run out of base content. Just like Minecraft, you pay once and get
      all of that.

      If we agreed on that, the download will be available in the pinned
      messages of our ``#gaming`` Discord channel. Instructions are in the
      same message.
