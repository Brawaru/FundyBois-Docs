FUNDY BOIS SMP
==============

To spend time together, while Fundy is not streaming, we have a made a
Minecraft server that everyone invited to the Discord can join.

How to join
-----------

Our server is currently at **1.16.4** version, hosted in Europe.

Address to connect to is available in ``#gaming`` Discord channel.

:doc:`OptiFine <optifine>` or :doc:`Sodium <sodium>` are recommended.

Rules
-----

This is non-exhaustive list of rules:

1. **Any form of hacking or cheating is forbidden.**

   This includes using X-ray, hacked clients or client modifications,
   which give you an advantage over other players. Vanilla tweaks, such as
   outline resource packs are fine, though.

2. **Do not build lag farms.**

   Farms that cause serious performance degradation of the server are
   subject to removal or culling.

   Spawners must be carefully used, especially cave spider ones, as cave
   spiders tend to bypass entity cramming and cause server performance issues
   if many are spawned. Villagers also are used to causing a lot of stress
   on the server, so avoid breeding them too much.

3. **Griefing is not allowed.**

   We consider griefing an intended destroying or corruption of other players'
   builds. However, if both parties mutually agree on having their builds
   griefed in the result of their play (such as ‘having a war’), this rule
   is disregarded.

   Accidental griefing (for example, by blowing up a creeper) is not
   accounted for this rule, though we expect players to repair damages
   as a sign of goodwill.

4. **No going to the end, killing the ender dragon and visiting cities.**

   We know that stuff, such as Elytra, is very fun to have, but let's leave
   ender dragon fight for the future! If you have found stronghold by chance,
   do not try to fill portal with eyes of ender.

5. **General rules of Discord apply to the in-game chat and participation.**

   This includes extreme discourtesy, calling other players names,
   inappropriate content, etc.
