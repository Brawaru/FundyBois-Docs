TheCo(g)sSMP
============

This is an another of our SMPs, dedicated to mod Create.

Create is a fantastic technological (steampunk?) mod that adds lots of
machinery to the Minecraft world. Unlike regular mods, Create has a very
aesthetic feel to it — it's not just decorated blocks with custom
inventories.

How to join

Installing the pack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to join the server you have to install mod pack with all required
mods. To do so, you can either use GDLauncher (recommended), CurseForge or
pre-packed version.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Via GDLauncher

      **Last Updated**: 08/01/2021.

      GDLauncher can be used as an alternative to CurseForge if you don't
      want to do anything with Overwolf, or couldn't install it by some
      reason (no administrator access).

      It will download the mod pack just like CurseForge would do, as well as
      it can manage Java for you. All that without administrator access and
      shady and bloated applications like Overwolf.

      .. note::
         To use Microsoft Account with GDLauncher, you have to download a
         beta version of it available `on GitHub
         <https://github.com/gorilla-devs/GDLauncher/releases>`_. Latest
         published version is on top, might be marked as ‘Pre-release’.

      1. `Download and install GDLauncher <https://gdevs.io/>`_.
